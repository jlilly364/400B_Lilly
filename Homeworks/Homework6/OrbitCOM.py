Answers to questions:

    1. Q: How many close encounters will the MW and M31 experience in the 
          future?
       A: The MW and M31 will have 3 close encounters in the future
          (~3.97,5.87,6.64 billion years)
    
    2. Q: How is the time evolution of the separation and relative velocity
          related?
       A: When the separation is least (gravitational force between them is 
          greatest), the relative velocity is greatest. When the separation is 
          greatest (gravitational force between them is least), the relative 
          velocity is least. They boomerang around each other until merging.
          
    3. Q: When do M31 and the MW merge? What happen's to M33's orbit as they
          merge?
       A: M31 and the MW seem to merge in 6.64 billion years. When they merge, 
          M33 orbits the remnant galaxy with a regular period and average 
          relative velocity of 250 km/s. Over the next ~6 billion years,
          M33 falls into (gets closer to) the remnant galaxy.
